Jonathan is dead
And Abigail is watching his wheelchair burn

The flames lick the wooden floor
Spreading to the curtains, and then the draperies on the wall
Higher and higher they go
«I am the fire… I’m eating everything
I’ll bring this mansion down, through me they all must come»
Spirits flying through the air
Spirits crossing over to the other side
To rest in peace and never die again
And to be with long gone friends
The ghosts of those who lived here in the past
They will use the flames to leave this EVIL house
